# Py_Learning
Here I will document my Python learning journey form zero experience. I'll be focusing on project-based learning because I learn better by doing. I'm also gonna be using AI to help me learn.
I'm Using:
python 3.14
VS Code
Gemini Code Assit
NotebookLM
Perplexity for projects ideas

Progress:
Day 1:
My first python project was a Mad Libs Word Game
    I started by greating the user by using print comands, after i went into to collecting words from the user, for this I defined each word as a variable and used a input to get the word from the user. after wars i used story= f"""...""" and i wrote the stpry using the variables now defined to develop the story. after wards i use print to display the story. After this I used gemini code assist to learn how to save the sotry as file in the pc.
